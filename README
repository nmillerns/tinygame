tinygame

Nick Miller: nmillerns@hotmail.com


A very lightweight, highly documented, educational/demonstration library for creating simple text based games in Python. Intended for Raspberry Pi 


1. Contents:

./                          - The top level directory
./doc/                      - Documentation for this tinygame game library 
./doc/tinygame.html         - The entry point for the documentation. Load this in your browser
./doc/Makefile              - The make file to rebuild documentation as the code changes
./tinygame/                 - The library game code as a python module directory
./tinygame/__init__.py      - The main definitions of the library 
./tinygame/__main__.py      - The entry point for the module. It refers you to example games
./examples/                 - Example games implemented in python using tinygame. See Section 2 on how to run
./LICENSE                   - This is distributed with the MIT license


2. Instructions to Play Examples:

 - The example games are in the ./examples/ directory
 - They are meant to be run from this top level directory ./
 - e.g., navigate to this top level directory
 - run
   python examples/hello.py
   
   see examples/ for all the available example games including Tetris, Breakout, and Snake
   
3. Instructions to Build Documentation:
  
  - The documentation is built with gmake and pydoc
  - From this top level directory ./ type:
   make -f doc/Makefile clean
   make -f doc/Makefile all

4. Instructions to Code and Distribute tinygame games

  - tinygame is lightweight. So it is best to copy the ./tinygame folder as a subfolder in your game project folder
  - in your Python game code use "import tinygame" assuming your python code is at the top level of your folder
  - You may need to add the path to tinygame otherwise, see the games in ./example/ in this case
  - Happy coding! Feel free to email nmillerns@hotmail.com if to share anything you make
